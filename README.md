This is a website made for the final project of INFO 343, Client-Side Web Development. 
We created a web application using React Router, and made use of tools we've learned about such as Firebase, Materialize, BabyParse, jQuery, and other npm modules. All of these culminated into a website for a small bakery that includes basic information about the bakery, a blog for the owner to post about the breads she makes, as well as a store where someone could order some bread. We implemented authentication for the owner to be able to log in and edit parts of the site, including blog posts and store items.

2. The login form is in the footer on the bottom of the page.  
3. The login information to test from an admin perspective is the following:
