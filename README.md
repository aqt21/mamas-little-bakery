This is a website made for the final project of INFO 343, Client-Side Web Development. 
We created a web application using React Router, and made use of tools we've learned about such as Firebase, Materialize, BabyParse, jQuery, and other npm modules. All of these culminated into a website for a small bakery that includes basic information about the bakery, a blog for the owner to post about the breads she makes, as well as a store where someone could order some bread. We implemented authentication for the owner to be able to log in and edit parts of the site, including blog posts and store items. Our site is meant to make website management simple for the owner. The owner of the site can conveniently add and change components of the site through forms and buttons, rather than having to dig through the code to edit the site. This way, a business owner can control the content they want to display on their site and show off their creations without the obstacle of having to learn the technologies to do it.
  
Before viewing our project there are a couple things you must know.  
1. There is an admin account that is utilized to add blog posts and edit the store. The views changes whether or not you are logged in.  
2. The login form is in the footer on the bottom of the page.  
3. The login information to test from an admin perspective is the following:  
Email: mamaslittlebakery@gmail.com  
Password: cheesecake  
  
All of the Buy Now buttons in the store lead to a placeholder bread paypal page. We couldn't find a way to create a paypal page for every time a new product was added. If this were used by a real company then we would create a new paypal sale page for every new product that was added.
